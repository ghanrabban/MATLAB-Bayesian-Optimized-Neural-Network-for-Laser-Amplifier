# MATLAB Bayesian Optimized Neural Network for Laser Amplifier

The following are the primary codes for the forthcoming research titled "Enhancing Machine Learning Training for Gain Coefficient Estimation in Optical Fiber Amplifiers using Bayesian Optimization," which will soon be published in the IEEE Open Journal of Photonics.

There are two distinct codes:
- "BONN_Optical_Fiber.mlx" is the main code containing a machine learning algorithm enhanced by Bayesian optimization.
- "FNN_Optical_Fiber.mlx" is a supplementary code used for comparative analysis of training performance.

The "Doping Materials Datasets" folder is divided into "Preprocessed Dataset" and "Raw Dataset" subfolders. The Preprocessed Dataset folder contains a list of input data for machine learning training. Please do not modify these files. The Raw Dataset folder contains the original dataset collected from public [SOTON Databases](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/438624/) and [another from the same source](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/475237/).

Lastly, the "Simulation Results" folder contains a collection of training results and supplementary data for the research paper.
